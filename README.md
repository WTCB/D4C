# Introduction
This repository hosts a proposed exchange protocol for building data. 

# Model
If you want to integrate the exchange protocol in your application, you can find the documentation on the model here: [[JSON-LD model]](Model/README.md)\
It is structured as an JSON-LD schema. More info about JSON-LD: https://json-ld.org/

# Properties
The protocol uses URI's to identify properties. The properties are hosted on the test environment of the bSDD.\
Domain that hosts the properties: https://search-test.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/uri/bw/BW.\
Available properties on the above domain: https://search-test.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/uri/bw/BW/0.1 \
Example of such a property 'Global Warming Potential' fossil fuels: https://search-test.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/uri/bw/BW/0.1/prop/gwp-fossil \
If you want to search for other properties in the test environment use: https://search-test.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/\
