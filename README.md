# Introduction
This repository hosts a proposed exchange protocol for building data. 

# Model
If you want to integrate the exchange protocol in your application, you can find the documentation on the model here: [[Model]](Model/README.md).\ 

# Properties
The protocol uses URI's to identify properties. The properties are hosted on the test environment of the bSDD.\
Domain that hosts the properties: https://search-test.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/uri/bw/BW. \
Available properties on the above domain: https://search-test.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/uri/bw/BW/0.1 \
Example of such a property 'Global Warming Potential' fossil fuels: https://search-test.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/uri/bw/BW/0.1/prop/gwp-fossil \
If you want to search for other properties in the test environment use: https://search-test.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/ \

# Related standards and/or initiatives
This protocol is developed within a research project and can thus rapidely evolve. However, it is inspired by similar initiatives and tries to re-use concepts where possible, like:
